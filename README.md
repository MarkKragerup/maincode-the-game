# Maincode - the game!
Welcome to our gamified portfolio tour. The goal of this project is to make a classic style RPG game using the Create-React-App with Typescript and minimal other dependencies. The insentive is teambuilding, practise within the framework and proof of concept as well as inspiration for other React.js fans.

The project follows the rules that;
- The game in its entirety must be coded by hand. No dependencies for game-engines, UI-libraries and such are allowed.
- The graphics must be hand crafted, entirely drawn or styled by the teammembers.

Try the game now, at [play.maincode.dk]()!
